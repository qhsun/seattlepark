# Class ParkingRecommender
# This class defines a ParkingRecommender object that is initialized with a
# list of ParkingSpot objects and a datetime (as a string), which are stored
# as class attributes.

# IMPORTANT NOTE!!!!
# This replaces the slice_df.py, max_freespace.py, and where_to_park.py
# modules! So don't use those anymore.

# The __init__ method is the constructor of the ParkingRecommender object
# and parses the datetime input and filters the full parking study dataset
# down to just the streets in the ParkingSpot list, using method slice_df().

# The max_freespace method uses that filtered dataset and returns the 5
# streets with the highest estimated parking availability, based on average
# observed availability from the parking study data.

# Use this method as follows:

# "ps" is a list of ParkingSpot objects (at least 5 entries)
# "dt" is a datetime string such as '2020-02-04 12:46:29.315237'
# pr = ParkingRecommender(ps,dt)
# output = pr.recommend()
# Here, output is a list of 5 ParkingSpot objects, with their .spaceavail
# attributes filled in.
