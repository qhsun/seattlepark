## seattlepark

Finding parking in the Seattle area can sometimes be an arduous task.  Free street parking is difficult to find, can be on narrow streets, and time-limited in residential zones often to 2 hours. Paid street parking is often just as difficult to find.

Our solution is an interactive API using the Seattle Annual Parking Study, which records street parking usage at various times of day on streets throughout the city to create a suggestion for most-likely-available streets to park in based on a user’s inputted destination.

#### Note for users after March 21, 2021
The API key that is currently encoded in this repository will be deactivated after March 21, 2021. New users will need to [create their own API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key), encode it, and paste it in to ./seattlepark/src/resources/google_maps_api.key .

Once all dependencies are installed, open and run the python file "parking_app.py" in the src directory:

```bash
python seattlepark/src/parking_app.py
```

You should get output that looks similar to this:
```bash
 * Debug mode: off
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```
Copy and paste the link into your browser to interact with the API.

## Using the seattlepark app

Once you have the app set up and running, you're ready to take advantage of its functions. 

- Enter a Seattle street address and enter the distance you're willing to walk from your parking location to your destination.
    - Ex: 400 Broad St, Seattle, WA 98109 (Space Needle), or 4000 15th Ave NE, Seattle, WA 98195 (Suzzallo Library)
- The map will update with a dot to indicate the destination along with lines to indicate potential streets to park.
- Hover over the lines to see the average available parking spaces on that street around the time that you are accessing the API. Happy parking!
